# Marketing Campaign ROI Analysis with Machine Learning

## üìä Project Overview
This project analyzes the return on investment (ROI) of a bank‚Äôs marketing campaign to predict customer subscription to term deposits. The analysis focuses on comparing the ROI in two scenarios:
1. **Actual Outcomes**: The actual ROI based on customer behavior during the campaign.
2. **Model Predictions**: The ROI based on predictions made by a machine learning model (LightGBM), where we compute the cost of incorrect predictions and the revenue from correct predictions.

The project demonstrates how incorporating machine learning can optimize marketing campaigns and boost ROI by targeting the right customers, reducing unnecessary costs, and increasing revenue.

## üìù Project Objectives
- **Scenario 1**: Calculate the ROI when sending the campaign to **all customers** and only receiving revenue from customers who actually subscribed.
- **Scenario 2**: Calculate the ROI using a **machine learning model** to predict which customers are likely to subscribe and adjusting the cost based on correct/incorrect predictions.
- Compare the two scenarios to evaluate the potential savings and revenue boost by incorporating a machine learning model.

## üõ† Preprocessing Steps
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A thorough **EDA** was performed to understand the characteristics of the dataset and identify patterns in customer behavior, such as:
- **Distribution of customer demographics**: Age, job, marital status, and education level.
- **Previous interactions**: Number of previous contacts, outcome of previous campaigns, and other historical data.
- **Campaign effectiveness**: Number of contacts made before a customer subscribed.
- **Economic indicators**: Features like the **consumer price index** and **confidence index** were analyzed to understand their influence on subscription rates.

### Key Insights from EDA:
- Customers who had longer interactions (call duration) tended to be more likely to subscribe.
- The **number of previous contacts** and the outcome of previous campaigns had a strong influence on whether customers would subscribe in the current campaign.
- **Economic factors** like the **consumer price index** and the **employment variation rate** were influential in determining subscription rates.

### Handling Class Imbalance: Upsampling
The dataset had a significant class imbalance, with many more "no" responses (customers not subscribing) compared to "yes" responses (customers subscribing). To address this imbalance:
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** was applied to upsample the minority class ("yes" responses). This ensures the model learns from both classes and doesn't become biased toward the majority class.
- This preprocessing step improved the model‚Äôs ability to predict customer subscription by balancing the class distribution in the training data.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **ROI Calculation**:
  - **Scenario 1**: Actual ROI calculated from all customer outreach and actual subscriptions.
  - **Scenario 2**: Predicted ROI calculated by using a LightGBM model to predict customer subscriptions and adjusting the cost/revenue accordingly.
  
- **Cost vs. Revenue Breakdown**:
  - Understand the total cost incurred by contacting customers in the campaign.
  - Compare the revenue generated by customers who actually subscribed vs. model-predicted subscriptions.

- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting model used to predict customer subscription based on features like customer age, previous campaign outcomes, and more.
  - Feature importance analysis to understand which factors drive customer subscriptions.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - **Grid Search CV** was applied to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the **LightGBM** model, optimizing key parameters such as:
    - **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size during model training.
    - **Number of Leaves**: Controls the complexity of the trees.
    - **Min Data in Leaf**: Ensures that the leaf nodes have a sufficient amount of data points.
  - Cross-validation was used to ensure that the model's performance is generalizable.

## üìÇ Project Structure
The project contains the following components:

- **`Enhanced_MarketingCampaignAnalysis_Final.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook where the analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and ROI calculations are performed.
- **Data**: The dataset used in this project contains marketing campaign information, customer demographics, and subscription outcomes.
- **Model**: The LightGBM model is trained using key customer features to predict subscription outcomes.

## üìà Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model used in this project is **LightGBM**, a powerful gradient boosting model. The model was trained on key customer features and campaign data to predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit.

### Model Features:
- **Top Features**: 
  - Duration of the call
  - Age
  - Number of previous contacts
  - Education
  - Housing
  - And more...

### Model Evaluation:
The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score, and feature importance analysis was conducted to understand the key drivers of customer subscriptions.

## üõ† Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/marketing-campaign-analysis.git
    cd marketing-campaign-analysis
    ```

2. Install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Launch the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Enhanced_MarketingCampaignAnalysis_Final.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and calculate the ROI for both scenarios.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is a bank marketing dataset containing information about customer outreach efforts and subscription outcomes. Key features include:
- **Age**
- **Job**
- **Marital Status**
- **Number of previous contacts**
- **Duration**


You can find the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) or use the provided CSV file in the repository.

## üí° Key Insights
1. **Campaign Strategy**: Using a machine learning model can significantly improve the ROI of marketing campaigns by reducing the cost of contacting unlikely customers and focusing efforts on customers with a higher likelihood of subscription.
   
2. **Feature Importance**: The duration of the call and the customer‚Äôs previous interactions with the bank were significant predictors of subscription success.

3. **ROI Comparison**:
   - **Without Model**: When contacting all customers, the ROI was lower due to unnecessary costs incurred from non-subscribers.
   - **With Model**: The ROI improved significantly by targeting the right customers based on model predictions, reducing costs from incorrect outreach.

## üîç Example Results

| Scenario      | Total Cost | Total Revenue | ROI      |
|---------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| Actual Outcomes | $50,000    | $80,000       | 60.00%   |
| Model Predictions | $30,000   | $70,000       | 133.33%  |

The above table shows the comparison of the total costs, revenue, and ROI between using actual campaign results vs. machine learning predictions.
